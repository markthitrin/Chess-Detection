The dataset includes 709 images.
Pieces are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 5 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -3 and +3 degrees
* Random shear of between -3° to +3° horizontally and -3° to +3° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
